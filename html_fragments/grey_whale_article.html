                <h2>The Grey Whale: The Migratory Marvel</h2>
    <p>The <strong>grey whale</strong> (<em>Eschrichtius robustus</em>) is one of the most fascinating and resilient creatures of the ocean. Known for its incredible migrations and distinctive features, the grey whale has long captured the attention of marine biologists and enthusiasts. This article delves into the physical description, life, habitat, and unique behaviors of the grey whale, along with some interesting facts about this remarkable marine mammal.</p>

    <h3>Physical Description</h3>
    <p>The grey whale is a large, baleen whale, although not as massive as its close relatives, such as the blue whale. Adult grey whales typically reach lengths of about <strong>40 to 50 feet</strong> (12 to 15 meters) and can weigh up to <strong>40 tons</strong>. Their bodies are usually covered in a mottled grey coloration, with patches of white, light grey, or black on their skin. This unique coloration helps them blend in with the ocean waters.</p>
    <p>One of the distinguishing features of the grey whale is its <strong>rough skin</strong>. Unlike most other whales, grey whales have noticeable patches of scars, parasites, and barnacles on their skin, which gives them a worn, textured appearance. Their dorsal fin is small and located far back, and their tail flukes are broad and triangular, essential for long-distance swimming.</p>
    <p>Grey whales also have baleen plates in their mouths instead of teeth, which they use to filter food from the water. These plates are made of keratin, similar to human fingernails, and they enable the whale to feed by straining large amounts of water and sifting out the tiny marine creatures that make up their diet.</p>

    <h3>Life and Behavior</h3>
    <p>Grey whales are primarily <strong>bottom feeders</strong>, a rare trait among baleen whales. They are known for their <strong>unique feeding behavior</strong> called "suction feeding," in which they dive to the ocean floor and scoop up sediment and small invertebrates such as amphipods, worms, and mollusks. They filter the mud and sand through their baleen plates to capture their prey, a method that distinguishes them from other baleen whales that primarily feed on plankton.</p>
    <p>These whales are also famous for their <strong>incredible migration</strong>. Every year, grey whales undertake one of the longest migrations of any mammal, traveling approximately <strong>10,000 to 12,000 miles</strong> (16,000 to 20,000 kilometers) round-trip. They migrate from their feeding grounds in the Arctic Ocean to warmer breeding lagoons off the coast of Baja California, Mexico, where they give birth and mate before heading back north to feed.</p>
    <p>Grey whales are generally solitary animals but may be seen in small groups, especially during migration. During migration, mothers travel with their calves, who are born in the warm waters of Baja California. The calves are born already measuring <strong>14 to 16 feet</strong> (4 to 5 meters) long and weigh approximately <strong>2,000 pounds</strong> (900 kg).</p>

    <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
    <p>Grey whales are found primarily along the <strong>Pacific coast</strong>. They migrate between the feeding grounds in the <strong>Arctic</strong> and the breeding lagoons in <strong>Baja California, Mexico</strong>. While their migration route is one of the longest known among mammals, grey whales are found in other areas as well, including the <strong>Sea of Okhotsk</strong> near Russia, and the <strong>Chukchi Sea</strong> north of Alaska.</p>
    <p>Though grey whales were once found in other parts of the world, their range has contracted over time. Today, most grey whale populations are concentrated in the <strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong>. The <strong>Western North Pacific</strong> population, which migrates off the coast of Japan, remains critically endangered due to past hunting and low reproductive rates.</p>
    <p>During migration, grey whales are frequently seen along the west coast of North America, from Alaska down to Mexico. Their presence has become a significant draw for whale watching and ecotourism, with observers flocking to locations like <strong>California's Monterey Bay</strong> and <strong>Oregon's coast</strong> during the migration seasons.</p>

    <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Migration Marvel:</strong> The grey whale's migration is one of the longest migrations of any mammal, with some individuals traveling up to <strong>12,000 miles</strong> (19,000 kilometers) annually, which can take around <strong>two to three months</strong> each way.</li>
        <li><strong>Endangered Status:</strong> The grey whale was heavily hunted during the whaling era, and while populations have rebounded since hunting ceased, the <strong>Western North Pacific population</strong> remains critically endangered, with estimates of fewer than 100 individuals remaining.</li>
        <li><strong>Calves and Birth:</strong> Grey whale calves are born in the <strong>warm lagoons</strong> off Baja California, Mexico, where the temperature is more favorable for birth and early development. The calves are fed rich milk and grow rapidly during this period.</li>
        <li><strong>Unique Feeding Method:</strong> Unlike most baleen whales, which feed on plankton, grey whales are <strong>bottom feeders</strong> and use their long, flexible bodies to scoop up the ocean floor and filter small invertebrates through their baleen plates.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Behavior:</strong> While generally solitary, grey whales are known to be <strong>social during migration</strong> and can sometimes be seen in groups of two or more. They also interact with boats and observers, often breaching or swimming alongside boats.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Grey whales use a variety of sounds, including <strong>grunts</strong>, <strong>moans</strong>, and <strong>whistles</strong>. These vocalizations are believed to play a role in navigation, communication, and social interaction, especially during migration.</li>
