    <h2>The Blue Whale: The Giant of the Oceans</h2>
    <p>The <strong>blue whale</strong> (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>) is not only the largest living animal on Earth but also the largest animal to have ever existed, outstripping even the largest dinosaurs in size. A true marvel of nature, blue whales have captivated scientists and ocean enthusiasts for centuries. Below, we explore their physical characteristics, life, habitat, and some fascinating facts about these incredible creatures.</p>

    <h3>Physical Description</h3>
    <p>The blue whale is massive, with adults reaching lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) and weighing as much as <strong>200 tons</strong> or more. This colossal size is one of the whale’s most striking features. Its body is long, streamlined, and typically a mottled blue-grey in color, with lighter undersides. The skin often appears blue when seen underwater, but on the surface, it can look greyish or even yellowish due to the accumulation of diatoms (tiny marine organisms) on the skin.</p>
    <p>The blue whale’s heart is equally impressive. It can weigh as much as a small car (around <strong>1,300 pounds or 590 kg</strong>) and is large enough for a human to crawl through the aorta. The animal’s tongue alone can weigh as much as an elephant!</p>
    <p>Despite their enormous size, blue whales have relatively small dorsal fins located far back on their bodies and long, slender flippers. Their flukes (tail fins) are wide and triangular, allowing them to glide smoothly through the water with minimal effort.</p>

    <h3>Life and Behavior</h3>
    <p>Blue whales are <strong>filter feeders</strong>, meaning they feed by straining large quantities of water through their baleen plates (which are comb-like structures in their mouths). Each day, a blue whale can consume up to <strong>4 tons of krill</strong>, their primary food source. This feeding technique, known as lunge feeding, involves swimming at high speed through dense swarms of krill with their mouths wide open.</p>
    <p>These whales are known for their <strong>long migrations</strong>, traveling thousands of miles annually. In the winter, they head toward warmer, tropical waters to mate and give birth, while in the summer months, they move to colder, nutrient-rich waters to feed.</p>
    <p>Although blue whales are solitary or found in small groups, they do occasionally form loose aggregations when feeding. Their <strong>vocalizations</strong> are some of the loudest sounds produced by any animal, reaching up to <strong>188 decibels</strong>. These calls can be heard over hundreds of miles underwater, likely serving in communication and navigation.</p>

    <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
    <p>Blue whales are found in all of the world's oceans, although they tend to migrate between feeding grounds in polar waters during the summer and warmer equatorial waters during the winter. They are most commonly seen in the <strong>Southern Ocean</strong>, around the coasts of Antarctica, where they feed on krill. In the Northern Hemisphere, blue whales are found in areas like the <strong>North Pacific</strong>, <strong>North Atlantic</strong>, and the <strong>Gulf of California</strong>.</p>
    <p>In recent years, blue whale populations have faced threats due to <strong>shipping lanes</strong>, <strong>fishing nets</strong>, and the ongoing impacts of climate change. However, these whales continue to inhabit many areas globally, albeit in reduced numbers.</p>

    <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Feeding Frenzy:</strong> A blue whale’s stomach can hold up to <strong>2,000 gallons</strong> (about 7,500 liters) of food and water. When feeding, they take in enormous gulps of water filled with krill, filtering the tiny creatures out and swallowing them whole.</li>
        <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Blue whales typically live <strong>70 to 90 years</strong>, although some can live well over 100 years. Their lifespan is marked by slow growth and maturity, with calves being born after a <strong>10 to 12-month gestation</strong> period.</li>
        <li><strong>Newborn Giants:</strong> At birth, blue whale calves are already around <strong>23 feet (7 meters)</strong> long and weigh about <strong>3 tons</strong>. They are nursed by their mothers for about <strong>6 to 7 months</strong>, consuming up to <strong>100 gallons of milk</strong> per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Endangered Status:</strong> Blue whales were heavily hunted during the 19th and early 20th centuries, nearly driving them to extinction. Though commercial whaling has largely ceased, they are still classified as <strong>endangered</strong> under the <strong>IUCN Red List</strong>, with an estimated population of only <strong>10,000 to 25,000 individuals</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Despite their size, blue whales can reach speeds of <strong>20 miles per hour</strong> (32 km/h) in short bursts, although they typically cruise at much slower speeds of around <strong>5 miles per hour</strong> (8 km/h).</li>
